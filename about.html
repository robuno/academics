                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Hi! I am Zana, a second year PhD Student at Harvard. My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of AI and HCI.

                        I design, build and evaluate AI-powered systems for decision-making support. I am also enthusiastic about FAT (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency) in machine learning and AI for Social Good. </p>
                        
                        <p>Prior to joining Intelligent Interactive Systems group as a PhD student, I was a member of the Intelligent User Interfaces Lab and the Multimedia, Vision & Graphics Lab at Koc University in Turkey, from where I obtained my master's degree in 2019.  I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Izmir Institute of Technology in 2016.</p>
                        
                        <p>Originally, I come from the capital city of a small country in southeastern Europe - Prishtina, Kosovo. </p>
